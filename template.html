        <h2>Athena Evans</h2>
         <p>My name is Athena Evans. Currently, I am a senior in high school looking for more ways to expand my skill set. As part of the generation who grew up online, the internet has provided many social and financial opportunities for me to take by putting forward my artistic work. I recognize everyday that I am only able to bring in funds comparable to my peersâ€™ part time jobs because of technology. From the illustration and modeling programs I use to the servers and platforms that I use to host my work, I have come to learn that the better I understand technology, the more I can utilize it to the fullest and resonate with the most people.</p>
         <p>In the future, I aspire to attend an art college and eventually find a career as a game artist or architect. While that is not directly attached to web development, in recent years I have found myself ready for more professional artistic opportunities, and am excited to learn how to structure websites. A large goal of mine is to develop my own personal website to showcase my work, and I look forward to gaining more knowledge on the topic of web design.</p>
